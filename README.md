# Stay Positive!
This is a website I built to collect positive articles/images from people during COVID-19.

You can submit positive articles/images [here](https://forms.gle/c47jrfVSH89Ngui16), and view the actual website [here](http://stay-positive.georgesaieed.com/).

There is no "back-end" - the submission link above links to a Google Form which feeds into a Google Spreadsheet. The website pulls its data from this.
